=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned> using simple 'since' and 'until' markers within result classes to specify the schema version at which classes and columns were introduced or removed. Column since/until definitions are included as part of 'extra' info in add_column(s).

=head2 since

When a class is added to a schema at a specific schema version version then a 'since' method must be added to the class which returns the version at which the class was added. For example:

C<< sub since { '1.002' } >>

It is not necessary to add this method to the initial version of a class since any class without this method is assumed to have existed for ever.

Using 'since' in a column definition denotes when the column was added OR when changes were last made to the column.

=head2 until

When used as a class method this should return the final schema version at which the class is to be used. The underlying database table will be removed when the schema is upgraded to a higher version. Example method definition:

C<< sub until { '1.999' } >>

Using 'until' in a column definition will cause removal of the column from the table when the schema is upgraded past this version.

=head1 METHODS

Many methods are inherited or overloaded from L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned>.

=head2 connection

Overloaded method. This checks the DBIC schema version against the DB version and warns if they are not the same or if the DB is unversioned.

To avoid the checks on connect, set the environment var DBIC_NO_VERSION_CHECK or alternatively you can set the ignore_version attr in the forth argument like so:

  my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect(
    $dsn,
    $user,
    $password,
    { ignore_version => 1 },
  );


=cut

=head2 deploy

Inherited method. Same as L<DBIx::Class::Schema/deploy> but also calls C<install>.

=head2 install

Inherited method. Call this to initialise a previously unversioned database.

=head2 ordered_schema_versions

Overloaded method. Returns an ordered list of schema versions. This is then used to produce a set of steps to upgrade through to achieve the required schema version.


=cut

=head2 _cleanup_versions

Used to weed out classes and columns that are not appropriate for our current database version based on since/until values. Collects available versions at the same time.


=cut

=head2 upgrade

Inherited method. Call this to attempt to upgrade your database from the version it is at to the version this DBIC schema is at. If they are the same it does nothing.

=head2 upgrade_single_step

=over 4
 
=item Arguments: db_version - the version currently within the db
 
=item Arguments: target_version - the version to upgrade to

=back

Overloaded method. Call this to attempt to upgrade your database from the I<db_version> to the I<target_version>. If they are the same it does nothing.

All upgrade operations within this step are performed inside a single transaction so either all succeed or all fail. If successful the dbix_class_schema_versions table is updated with the I<target_version>.

This method may be called repeatedly by the L</upgrade> method to upgrade through a series of updates.
